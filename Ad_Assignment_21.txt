Q1. What is a probability distribution, exactly? If the values are meant to be random, how can you predict them at all?
Ans- It helps to plot out all the different outcomes of an experiment. 
     Adding all the probabilities helps predict a range.




Q2. Is there a distinction between true random numbers and pseudo-random numbers, if there is one? Why are the latter considered “good enough”?
Ans- Random numbers use unpredictable physical means to generate numbers and Pseudo-random numbers use mathematical algorithms.
     Pseudo- Random numbers produces sequences of random numbers based on a algorithm and thus are not predictable thus more preferred.




Q3. What are the two main factors that influence the behaviour of a "normal" probability distribution?
Ans- Mean and standard deviation





Q4. Provide a real-life example of a normal distribution.
Ans-Tossing a coin





Q5. In the short term, how can you expect a probability distribution to behave? What do you think will happen as the number of trials grows?
Ans- The short term results can be vague and include multiple factors.
    As number of trials grow the probability of success increases and gets closer to a normal distribution.



Q6. What kind of object can be shuffled by using random.shuffle?

Ans- Lists




Q7. Describe the math package's general categories of functions.
ANs- 





Q8. What is the relationship between exponentiation and logarithms?
ANs- Logarithmic functions are always inverses of exponential functions.






Q9. What are the three logarithmic functions that Python supports?
Ans- log(a,(Base))
     log2(a)
     log10(a)

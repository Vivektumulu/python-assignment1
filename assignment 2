Q1
There are two types of boolean data types, namely true and false
they are written as true- 1 and false - 0

Q2
There are three types of boolean operators
AND, OR, NOT

Q3
List of each boolean operator's truth tables
AND gate                        NAND gate
InputA  InputB  Output         InputA  InputB  Output  
1         0         0            1      0        1
0         1         0            0      1        1
1         1         1            1      1        0 
0         0         0            0      0        1

OR gate                         NOR gate
InputA  InputB  Output         InputA  InputB  Output  
1         0         1            1      0        0
0         1         1            0      1        0
1         1         1            1      1        0 
0         0         0            0      0        1

NOT gate
Input A  Output
1         0 
0         1

Q4
(5>4) and (3==5)- False
not (5>4)- False
(5>4) or (3==5)- True
not ((5>4) or (3==5))- True
(True and True) and (True== False)- False
(not False) or (not True)- True

Q5
Less than<
Greater than>
Less than or equal to <=
Greater than or equal to >=
Equal to ==
Not equal !=

Q6
Difference between equal to and assignment operator
"==" Equal to is used when it is required to check whether the values on both sides are same or not.
"=" assignment operator is used to assign a value.

Eg. 51==51 will display true if satisfied
Eg  s= 52 the next time we enter s, 52 will be displayed as its assigned value is defined.

Q7
the correct indentation should be
spam= 0
if spam == 10: # block 1
    print('eggs')
    if spam >5 :
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam') # block 2
print('spam') # block 3


Q8
if spam==1:

Q1. What is the difference between __getattr__ and __getattribute__?
Ans- _getattr_ it is called at all times; it has low priority
     _getattribute_ gets called whether there is attribute or not; it has high priority

Q2. What is the difference between properties and descriptors?
Ans-   descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed.
       properties are a high-level application of this;that is properties are implemented using descriptors.

Q3. What are the key differences in functionality between __getattr__ and __getattribute__, as well as properties and descriptors?
Ans-  __getattr__ is only invoked if the attribute wasn't found the usual ways.
     __getattribute__ is invoked before looking at the actual attributes on the object and so can be tricky to implement correctly.

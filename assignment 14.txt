1. What does RGBA stand for?
Ans- Red-Green-Blue_Alpha

2. From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?
Ans-   Import the image module from the Pillow library from PIL import Image.
      Open any image and get the 
      RAGBAG values.img =Image.open('image.png') & rgba =img.convert(“RGBA”)
      Change the color
      data will be an imaging Core object containing thousands of tuples of RGBA values and finally store the changed image.

3. What is a box tuple, and how does it work?
Ans-   Tuple is a data structure that is employed to store multiple data at one time.
       The data stored in a tuple are heterogeneous and this indeed makes it the most powerful feature of the tuple in Python.

4. Use your image and load in notebook then, How can you find out the width and height of an Image object?
Ans- first create an empty Markdown cell,then drag-and-drop the image file into the empty Markdown cell and then 
  image = PIL. 
  Image.open("sample.png") image to open.
  width, height = image. size. extract width and height from output tuple.
  print(width, height)
  
5. What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?
Ans-    the resize() method to resize the image.

6. After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?
Ans-   save() saves this image under the given filename,if no format is specified then the format to use is determined from the filename extension.

7. What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?
Ans- image.save('image101.png')

8. Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?
Ans- 
img_draw = ImageDraw.Draw(canvas)
img_draw.rectangle((70, 50, 300, 200), outline='red', fill='blue')
img_draw.text((100, 100), 'Hello World', fill='green')
canvas.save('drawn_image.jpg')

Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?

Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object's error message.


Ans- the two methods are


for line in open("myfile.txt"):
    print(line, end="")


And with command in statement enables cleaning


with open("myfile.txt") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line, end="")




Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?


Ans-  Python class definitions for the standard exceptions are imported from the standard module "exceptions". You can't change this file thinking that the changes will automatically show up in the standard exceptions; the builtin module expects the current hierarchy as defined in exceptions.py.

Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?
Ans-   In object-oriented programming, a metaclass is a class whose instances are classes.
      Just as an ordinary class defines the behavior of certain objects, a metaclass defines the behavior of certain classes and their instances. 
      Not all object-oriented programming languages support metaclasses.



Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?
Ans- at the module level".because this way all classes of this module will be created using this metaclass and we just have to tell the metaclass
     to turn all attributes to uppercase.


Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?
Ans- metaclasses are designed to manage classes and applying them to managing instances is less straightforward.


Q4. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling instances?
Ans- Because they work by automatically rebinding a class name to the result of a function,
though there's no reason that we can't use them to augment the class before any instances are ever created.
